                            <p>In many cases, a medical exam is required to obtain life insurance, especially for larger coverage amounts. The exam helps the insurance company assess the applicant's health and determine the risk. However, some policies, such as simplified issue or guaranteed issue policies, may not require
                                a medical exam but may have limitations or higher premiums.</p>

                            <p>Yes, it is possible to have multiple life insurance policies. Many people opt for multiple policies to provide additional coverage or to have different types of coverage,
